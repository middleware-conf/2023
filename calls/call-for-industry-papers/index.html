            <h1>CALL FOR INDUSTRY PAPERS</h1>
            <p align="justify">The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference is a major forum for the discussion of innovations and recent advances in the design, construction and use of middleware systems. The Industrial Track of the Middleware 2023 Conference solicits 6-page papers for presentation during the main conference (single track) and inclusion in the ACM Digital Library. The topics of interest are similar to those in the general conference call for papers. However, the purpose of the Industrial Track is to emphasize the practical issues, observations, and measurements of “real-world” systems and applications and to disseminate information of particular interest to middleware researchers, architects, developers and administrators.</p>

            <h1>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h1>
            
            <p align="justify">A submission must be a single PDF file conforming to the formatting instructions of the ACM SIGPLAN style, which can be found on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ACM template page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and must not exceed 6 pages (including abstract, figures, tables, and appendices, but excluding references). The font size has to be set to 9pt. Submissions that do not adhere to these guidelines or that violate formatting will be declined without review. Reviewing is single-blind; papers must include author names and affiliations. Authors are required to add “(industry track)” at the end of their paper title.</p>
            
            <p align="justify">Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the Industrial Track Program Committee.
              Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, technical soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. The committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.</p>
            
            <p align="justify">Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. The conference organizers, like those of other scientific conferences and journals, prohibit these practices and may take actions against authors who have committed them. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. If you are uncertain whether your submission meets the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs.</p>
            
            <p align="justify">By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference and present the paper in person.</p>
